# Software process

## Suggested software process:

The software process suggested was an **incremental-agile** approach, where the specification, development and validation processes are interleaved.

Why was this approach suggested:

- Time was of the essence.

- We wanted to release a working version in the shortest possible time.

- Since we are a **group of 3** (Small team), **agile approach**was suitable.

## Phases:

The taken approach means that each successive version of the product is usable and each version adds some usabilitiy and functionality to the system.

Phases used include:

- Requirements. 

- Design. 

- Implementation.

- Testing.

With the constraint that there is no real customer and this project is more of a simulation a few assumptions were made and some constaints were added including:

- Requirements was no modifeid a lot throughout the project because there was no customer at hand, so **requirements document** were written at the beginning of the project and has not changed much since then.

- Testing was made on a subset of features not the system as a whole. 

- Since this is a management system, The ERD was the first diagram to be made and the most crucial one. It was highly utillized during the implementation phase. with specific requirements it also didn't change that much.
