# Design document

This project is build using on a **Client-server Architecture** (discussed in the previous section). 

**OOP**  was used in this project, since it's the most suitable for our application. which consists of: Member, employee, user and membership type. 

using **OOP** made it easier to model the database tables to our application using **ORM**(object relational model) and **DAO**(data access object). also made it possible to use **UML diagrams**to help in the design process.

## UML diagrams

### use case diagram:

A **use case diagram** is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and different types of users the system has and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses. The actors are often shown as stick figures.
