# Architectural design

## Suggested system architecture

The system architecture suggested for this project was **client-server architecure.**

Although this system is designed for a single computer the client-server architecture allows for future evolving of the project to be distributed accros a network and the ability to add several number of other clients (including phones). 

Reasons for using this architecture:

- Better system evolving. 

- Efficiency in delivering resources to the client. 

- Since the system is centralized, it can be easily **secured and maintained**. althought a single point of failure is regarded as a disadvantage, it allows for easirer maintenance and with a system that is not crucial it can tolerate occasional failure. 

- More clients can be added whenever we desire. 

## Suggested application architecture

The application architecture suggested and used for this project is **MVC**.

With a highly interactive appilcation rose the necesity for the separation between the **GUI** and the **logic** of the application. facilitated by using a database and a client-server architecture, it was an easy to task to apply MVC to our project.
